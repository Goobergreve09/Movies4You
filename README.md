## Description

The project is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline the organization and management of movies. Users can easily search for movies using the provided search bar, which retrieves comprehensive information about each film, including a poster image, plot summary, director, actors, title, rating, writer, and reviews from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic, courtesy of the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. Once users find movies of interest, they can seamlessly add them to their watchlist, which serves as a convenient way to track movies they plan to watch. The application records the date each movie is added to the watchlist, providing users with insight into how long a particular movie has been on their radar. Additionally, users can mark movies as favorites, categorizing them as all-time favorites or favorites by genre. This feature allows users to curate personalized lists of their preferred films, organizing them based on individual taste and genre preferences. Users can interact with the application by clicking intuitive icons: clicking the heart icon adds a movie to the favorites list, while clicking the eye icon adds it to the watchlist. Furthermore, the application offers customization options, enabling users to arrange their favorite movies in the order of preference and sort them based on criteria such as release date, rating, or genre. In essence, the project provides users with a seamless and personalized experience for discovering, organizing, and managing their movie preferences.

The motivation behind this project stems from a deep passion for movies and a desire to organize and centralize the vast array of films watched over time. As a dedicated movie enthusiast, the creator recognized the need for a comprehensive solution to manage their extensive collection of watched movies. The idea emerged from a personal longing to have a single platform where all favorite movies could be stored and organized systematically. By developing this web application, the creator sought to fulfill their own desire for a centralized repository of movie information, enabling them to easily track, categorize, and revisit films they've enjoyed. This project serves as a testament to the creator's love for cinema and their commitment to enhancing the movie-watching experience by providing a seamless and intuitive tool for movie organization and management.

## Usage

In order to use this page for your own platform and create your own organization is very simple since the application uses local storage. For starters, from the homepage simply type in the movie you are searching for into search bar.

![movies main (1)](https://github.com/Goobergreve09/Movies4You/assets/143923830/9481f3b8-dae7-4e54-bb24-33a086818e08)

Once the movie you are searching for has been rendered, you are given multiple options. As you can see from the image above, you can click on the heart to add a movie to your favorites, or the eye to add the movie to your personal watchlist. If you click on the *Read More* it will direct you to the imdb page of the specified movie.

![clicked](https://github.com/Goobergreve09/Movies4You/assets/143923830/ab5e224d-fc18-4728-b5bc-8313af77caac)

Once the heart and the eye have been clicked, they will change color to visualize that these have been added to the favorites and watchlist.

![all-time](https://github.com/Goobergreve09/Movies4You/assets/143923830/c78fd57e-fa27-465c-9792-1d4036cf45ae)
![watchlist](https://github.com/Goobergreve09/Movies4You/assets/143923830/758cf165-6e29-4dcb-849c-6f918c4c8403)
![comedy](https://github.com/Goobergreve09/Movies4You/assets/143923830/bfc89162-3760-42ec-a77d-15ffe7d05c0e)

Since the movie that was added to favorites was labeled under the comedy genre, it also renders the movie to the comedy favorites page, as well as the all-time favorites page. It also gets rendered to the watchlist when the eye is clicked, and you can see the date that it was added.

![Screenshot 2024-02-09 174810ll](https://github.com/Goobergreve09/Movies4You/assets/143923830/9d64ee3b-c317-49f6-b17b-9aac4057e9e4)

Once you have a list of multiple movies on a favorites page or watchlist, you can rearrange them by dragging them. If there is a movie you do not want on the list for your own personal reasons, you can simply click the trash icon in the top right icon of the movie, and it will be removed from the page. The camera logo in the top left will bring you the that movies imdb page for more information about the film, including trailers and videos.



## Future-Improvements

I am currently working on allowing it to be more responsive for mobile and tablet use, as well as increasing it's functionality when different browsers are being used.

My final goal for this application is to implement a backend so that users can login and see other's favorite movies and watch-lists, as well as implementing a user profile. On the profile you will be able to have images and other information. I would also like to implement a websocket for chatting, so that you can chat with other user's in relative to the 90's early 2000's AOL instant messenger. This could be an awesome way to keep in touch with others' movies - and in general bring everyone closer together through the cinematic art form.
